	<h2>Definition and Function</h2>
	<p>Recall that cells are enclosed in a cell membrane. The cell membrane defines the cell by separating it from its environment. The cell membrane is also essential to the cell's life processes because it regulates which materials enter and leave the cell.</p>

	<h2>Structure of Cell Membrane</h2>
	<p>The cell membrane serves as a means of transport and helps maintain homeostasis. A cell membrane is usually made up of two layers of lipids, oily or waxy organic molecules that tend to repel water. This structure is known as a lipid bilayer.</p>

	<h2>Homeostasis and Transport</h2>
	<p>The cell membrane helps maintain homeostasis by regulating which materials enter and leave the cell. Homeostasis is the ability of a cell or an organism to maintain stable internal conditions despite changes in its environment. The stable internal state is also called homeostasis. This balance allows cells to survive and function properly.</p>

	<h2>Nutrient Uptake and Waste</h2>
	<p>Cells have to take in nutrients to carry out the functions needed to sustain life. They must also release waste. One way materials enter and leave a cell is by diffusion. Diffusion is the movement of particles from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration. In other words, the particles travel from areas where they are crowded to areas where they are less crowded.</p>

	<h2>Passive Transport</h2>
	<p>Particles in solutions, such as those inside and outside a cell membrane, are in constant motion. The particles constantly collide with each other and tend to spread out randomly. Diffusion depends on the random movements of particles, so it does not require a cell to use energy. The movement of materials into or out of the cell without the expense of energy is called passive transport.</p>

	<h2>Equilibrium</h2>
	<p>Particles continue to diffuse into or out of a cell until their concentration is the same on both sides of the cell membrane. When particles reach this state of equal concentration, the system is at equilibrium. Once equilibrium is reached, particles continue to diffuse across the cell membrane in both directions. However, the same numbers of particles move in each direction, so the concentration does not change.</p>

	<h2>Selective Permeability</h2>
	<p>Not all particles can diffuse across a cell membrane. The cell membrane is a highly selective barrier that allows only some substances to move through it. A membrane is permeable to substances that can pass through it and impermeable to those that cannot. Cell membranes are selectively permeable; that is, they allow only some particles to pass through them.</p>

	<h2>Role of Water</h2>
	<p>Living cells are made up mostly of water. Water is an excellent solvent. A solvent is a substance in which other substances, or solutes, dissolve to form a solution. Many different compounds dissolve in water. In fact, cytoplasm is made up mostly of substances dissolved in water. For these reasons, water may be the most important substance that passes through the cell membrane. Water molecules pass through selectively permeable membranes by a type of diffusion known as osmosis. Solutions with equal concentrations on both sides of a membrane are isotonic. Equal amounts of water move into and out of the cell.</p>

	<h2>Osmosis and Concentration Gradients</h2>
	<p>A difference in concentration on opposite sides of a cell membrane makes osmosis possible. This difference is known as the concentration gradient. When there is a concentration gradient between a cell and its surroundings, the outside solution is either hypertonic or hypotonic. In a hypertonic solution, the concentration of solute outside the cell is higher than the concentration in the cytoplasm. When a cell is placed in a hypertonic solution, water moves out of the cell. This movement of water causes the cell to shrivel. In a hypotonic solution, the concentration of solute in the cytoplasm is higher than that outside the cell. When a cell is placed in a hypotonic solution, water moves into the cell. This causes the cell to swell and possibly burst.</p>

	<h2>Facilitated Diffusion</h2>
	<p>Some molecules move through the cell membrane by facilitated diffusion (also called facilitated transport). Facilitated diffusion is the movement of substances across a cell membrane with the aid of protein molecules embedded in the membrane. Facilitated diffusion helps specific molecules pass through the cell membrane. Recall that protein molecules are embedded in the lipid bilayer. Some of these molecules are referred to as protein channels. Each protein channel helps a specific type of molecule enter or leave the cell. Protein channels in red blood cells, for example, carry only glucose. Although the protein channel helps glucose move across the cell membrane, the process is still diffusion. It occurs only if there is a difference in concentration on the two sides of the cell membrane.</p>

	<h2>Active Transport</h2>
	<p>Recall that the movement of materials across a cell membrane by diffusion and osmosis does not use energy because materials are moving from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration. In some cases, the cell needs to move material from an area of low concentration to an area of high concentration. Moving material against the concentration gradient requires energy and is called active transport. In active transport, carrier proteins in the membrane move particles across it. A substance being transported binds to a specific carrier protein. Unlike a protein channel, a carrier protein does not provide an open pathway through the membrane. Instead, the arrangement of atoms in the molecule changes to allow a substance to move from one side to the other. One example of active transport is the sodium-potassium pump. Sodium ions (Na+) are pumped out of the cell, and potassium ions (K+) are pumped into the cell, by specific carrier proteins. The cell uses energy in the form of ATP to move these ions.</p>

	<h2>Endocytosis and Exocytosis</h2>
	<p>Some large molecules are transported by movements of the cell membrane itself. Endocytosis is a process in which a cell surrounds and takes in material from its environment. In endocytosis, the cell membrane folds and then forms a pocket enclosing some outside material. The pocket then separates from the cell membrane and forms a vacuole in the cytoplasm. The formation of this vacuole carries the material into the cell. Cells use the opposite process, exocytosis, to remove unwanted materials. During exocytosis, the membrane of a vacuole can fuse with the cell membrane. The contents of the vacuole are removed from the cell. Some organisms, such as amoebas and paramecia, release water in this way. Endocytosis and exocytosis are both forms of active transport.</p>
